title: Hello, Superflare
---

[Superflare](https://superflare.dev) is an experimental full-stack toolkit for Cloudflare Workers. It features a relational ORM for [D1 databases](/models/getting-started), utilities for [R2 storage](/file-storage), and lots more.

Superflare is _not_ a full-stack framework. In fact, Superflare works best when combined with [Remix](https://remix.run), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (soon!) or [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.com) (soon!).

Check out various Superflare [example apps](https://github.com/jplhomer/superflare/tree/main/examples/) to get a feel for what you can build next, or [get started](/getting-started) with a new Superflare application.

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/jplhomer/superflare), or create a new app right now:

```bash
npx superflare new
```

Superflare is a project created by me, [Josh Larson](https://jplhomer.org).

I'm doing this to have fun and not to support all of your production apps for $0. If you're curious, [read more about my design principles](/design).
